# Algorithm-Competition-Programme LaTeX Template

## Quickstart

To quickly start using the LaTeX template for either creating new bundle or editing the existing ones, you can create a new project in [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) and import the LaTeX files there.

Instead of using an online environment, if you want to compile the template locally, you should download and install **Pygments** in order to work on this template. 

For any problem or question, you can send a mail to contact@inzva.com
